Pure HTML webpage written in Clojure powered by Hiccup, with no
Javascript shipped on production.

TODO:
    - Reduce image sizes

Prerequisite
------------

Install dependencies below:

    - clojure <https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure>
    - stylus <https://stylus-lang.com/docs/executable.html>

Quick Start
-----------

Run the command below and everything should be built:

    ./build.sh

Then start your favorite server, I'd recommend to use:
    
    - Serve by Vercel <https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve>
    - Python HTTP Server <https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html>

This case we use Serve by Vercel:

    serve -d dist/

Routing
-------

The pages of the webpage is located at src/app/pages, which is a
semi automatic file-based routing. Essentially, the folder
structure determines the route path:

    - src/app/pages/index.clj -> /
    - src/app/pages/collections/index.clj -> /collections
    - src/app/pages/collections/movies.clj -> /collections/movies

However, this is not entirely 100% pure file-based routing. You
still need to specify the namespace of the file:

    - src/app/pages/index.clj -> (ns app.pages.index)
    - src/app/pages/collections/index.clj -> (ns app.pages.collections.index)
    - src/app/pages/collections/movies.clj -> (ns app.pages.collections.movies)

Testing
-------

Each tests should be written in python, as it is easier to parse
out html with existing libraries like `BeautifulSoup4`.

You should find all the test cases inside tests/ folder.

Contributing
------------

Any contribution is welcome, it is encouraged to create a new
branch with a prefix of patch-* before making any pull request.
